# S3 Overview

-   S3 is Râ€™s first and simplest OO system (This means there are other OO systems).
-   OO system = object-oriented system. An object-oriented system is a software development model that uses objects to represent different aspects of the application.
-   Since S3 has few built-in constraints -\> you should build the "constraints" yourself -\> for example making sure that the input is numeric if you need it to be numeric.

# Classes

Advanced R recommends that when you want to work with your own class you create:

-   A low-level **constructor**, `new_myclass()`: creates new objects with the correct structure.
-   A **validator**, `validate_myclass()`: performs more computationally expensive checks to ensure that the object has correct values.
-   A user-level **helper**, `myclass()`: provides a convenient way for others to create objects of your class.
